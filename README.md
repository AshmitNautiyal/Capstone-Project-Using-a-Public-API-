# Capstone-Project-Using-a-Public-API-
This is my capstone project that showcases a Pokémon Gallery built with Express.js, Node.js, EJS, HTML, and CSS. The application connects to the PokeAPI (https://pokeapi.co/) to display a variety of Pokémon with detailed information. Users can also search for specific Pokémon by name.
